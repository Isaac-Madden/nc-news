# Northcoders News API

## Welcome to my News API!

This is a backend service which can be used for accessing news articles and related data. 
Here's a link to the hosted site: https://maddens-news.onrender.com

It's fuctionality incudes a range of API calls, allowing a user to view a filtered list news articles, add comments and delete news data if you wish. 

A full list of the API endpoints available can be found in the endpoints.json file.

Itâ€™s built on Node.js with Express, and uses PostgreSQL for managing the data.
The database is stored on ElephantSQL and hosted using Render.

### To install the dependencies, 'npm install' into the terminal

Node.js : 20.3.0 and Postgres : 8.7.3 arethe minimum versions required.

### If you wish to run this locally, below is a list of dev-dependencies (and how to install them in the terminal):

    1 - jest (npm install jest -D)
    2 - jest extended (npm install jest-extended -D)
    3 - jest sorted (npm install jest-sorted -D)
    4 - PG Format (npm install pg-format -D)
    4 - supertest (npm install supertest -D)

### Make sure to add the following scripts to the package.json: 

    "setup-dbs": "psql -f ./db/setup.sql",
    "seed": "node ./db/seeds/run-seed.js",
    "test": "jest",
    "playground": "psql -f playground.sql > playground.txt",
    "playgroundTest": "psql -f playgroundTest.sql > playgroundTest.txt",
    "start": "node listen.js",
    "seed-prod": "NODE_ENV=production npm run seed"

### Some notes on the scripts:

    npm run setup-dbs - this will setup the databse 
    npm run seed - this will seed the database 
    npm test app.test.js - this will run the testing suit (__tests__/app.test.js)

### Finally, you will also need to connect to the databases:

To do this, add the environment variables by creating two .env files in the root folder:
    .env.test > PGDATABASE=nc_news_test
    .env.development > PGDATABASE=nc_news
